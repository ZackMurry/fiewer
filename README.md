## clearing lines
You can click the "Clear lines" button to clear all the functions currently on the screen.

## entering equations
There's a text box in the top-right where you can type in functions that you want to draw to the screen. The notation used is fairly intuitive and is similar to how you would write it.

Once you're satisfied with the text you've typed, you can press the enter key to draw it to the screen.

### finding the list of equations
By hitting the "Show info" button, you can view which functions are on the screen and which equation types are supported.  
Here's our log_2(x):

### multiple equations
You can also enter multiple functions at the same time.

## notation
You can enter functions with or without a "y=" in them, but there will always be a "y=" implied. PEMDAS is always respected. Here are some examples of the notation used:  
  y=3x  
  4x^2  
  5*4^x+3  
  5abs(3x)  
  -2log_3(5x)+3  
  y=-x
